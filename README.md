# Jieguoji - Open-Source Pretraining Corpus & Knowledge Base

## Overview

Jieguoji is an open-source corpus and knowledge base designed for pre-training and large model training. It provides high-quality data resources for researchers and developers in the fields of deep learning and natural language processing, supporting the training and optimization of AI models. This repository primarily focuses on small languages (low-resource languages) to help enrich the dataset diversity.

The data in this repository is licensed under the [Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (CC BY 4.0)](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/). You are free to share, modify, and use the data, as long as you provide appropriate credit to the original source.

## Data Integrity & Quality Assurance

All the data in this repository has undergone rigorous validity checks to ensure its integrity and accuracy. We have implemented multiple layers of validation to minimize data contamination and the inclusion of false or misleading information. This includes:

- **Data Cleaning**: Thorough filtering processes are applied to remove irrelevant, duplicate, or erroneous data entries.
- **Cross-validation**: Data is cross-checked with reputable sources to ensure consistency and correctness.
- **Continuous Monitoring**: Ongoing monitoring and updates to detect and eliminate data pollution or quality issues as they arise.

By ensuring high-quality data, Jieguoji contributes to the improvement of large model training, enhancing the performance of models in handling a wide range of languages, particularly those underrepresented in mainstream NLP datasets.
